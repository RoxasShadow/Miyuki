Miyuki â€“ Non ti lascia mai solo
===============================
After having configured the `example/miyuki.conf` configuration file, Miyuki lets you to have always the latest episodes of anime you're watching, downloading the episodes whenever they're available on Nyaa.

Of course, set the watch directory inside the configuration file to the one you've set in your torrent client.

Features
--------
- After having launched the daemon, the changes to the configuration file will be always syncronized without having restart Miyuki
- Whenever Miyuki finds out a new episode to download, you'll be notified with an alert (compatible with OSX natively and with Linux installing `libnotify`)
- Miyuki gives you a powerful way to search anime series through patterns

How to use
----------
`$ gem install miyuki`

`$ miyuki start example/miyuki.conf`

`$ miyuki stop` (or `$ miyuki kill`)

Known bugs
----------
- Nisekoi BDs are downloaded both in 720p and 1080p
